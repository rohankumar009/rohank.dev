          <p>
            I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, graduating in Dec 2025. I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering, data, and product execution.
            On campus and beyond, I’ve been involved in ACM, Chess, Game Dev, Lettuce Club, Run Club, Badminton, SASE, CodePath, NSBE, and SHPE. These communities shaped how I lead, collaborate, and mentor others. My approach emphasizes systems thinking, teaching, and ownership. I aim to build resilient systems, communicate clearly, and help teams move from ambiguity to outcomes.
